You want to bring the hot survivors to your yard, you gotta get swol, but exercise pain 12 hours later making you regret your life choices? 9 out of 10 gym rats and U.S. Marines recommend "IcyHot"!

Feel the power of science therapy! First its cold, then its hot which makes muscles feel better through the power of Science!

This mod adds tubes of "IcyHot" to the game! You'll find them at police and military installations of course. Your local pharmacy and any where medical supplies are found should also have some in stock. Other places may have them as well.

Each tube can treat 10 body parts experiencing exercise fatigue. If you have exercise fatigue, just right click the tube and apply! You'll rub it all over your fatigued body and feel the fast-acting pain relief. If you don't have any fatigued body parts, you're just wasting it, but if you feel it's necessary, treat yo self.

Each application of IcyHot will treat some of your exercise fatigue. If you've done burpess all night while watching "Life and Living TV" you've got a lot of fatigue built up and may need multiple applications. No product can totally relieve exercise fatigue though, so you will have some pain left even after a full treatment.

Spawn the item as "ICYHOT.IcyHotTube"

TODO:
- Figure out how to chain animations together so that the player is shown applying sweet pain relief goo to all arms and legs. The goo applies everywhere now, but only the left arm is animated.
- Might make the amount of goo and the amount of exercise fatigue decrease configurable.
- Implement a "case" of IcyHot.
